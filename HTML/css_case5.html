    It’s the face that launched a thousand memes. The surprise debut of the Child, a mysterious alien pursued by bounty hunters on behalf of Imperial interests, was revealed in the premiere episode of The Mandalorian — and now it has arrived on much-requested, official merchandise.

New toys and plush inspired by the character are now available for pre-order on shopDisney.com and StarWars.com has full details on the items up for pre-sale from Funko, Mattel and Buffalo Games, and more!
